## Welcome to CloginPy Page

Here's a short description of the cloginpy project

The idea is to replace expect-based clogin script with a _refined_ version powered by [netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko).


### Components

At the moment there are 2 scripts.
First `clogin.py` is the main script and is still work in progress
Second `cloginrc.py` reads `.cloginrc` configuration/credentials file using `fnmatch` glob matching function this is still work in progress
